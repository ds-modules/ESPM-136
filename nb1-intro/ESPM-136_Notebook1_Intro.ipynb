    "## A Brief History\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an _interactive computational environment_ that supports over **40** different programming languages, but was first released as a web-based interface for IPython in 2011. [Fernando Perez](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-p%C3%A9rez), a professor in the Statistics department here at UC Berkeley, created [IPython](https://ipython.org/) as a graduate student in 2001 and co-founded [Project Jupyter](https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/project-jupyter) in 2014. \n",
    "\n",
    "Project Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are `Julia`, `Python` and `R` (`\"ju\"` from `\"Julia\"`, `\"pyt\"` from `\"Python\"`, and `\"er\"` from `\"R\"`; all together you get `\"ju\" + \"pyt\" + \"er\" = \"jupyter\"`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The word notebook is an homage to Galileo's notebooks in which he documents his discovery of the the moons of Jupiter (the planet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the Jupyter Notebook interface has been around only about a decade, the first notebook interface, [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/), was released over 30 years ago in 1988. Other notebook interfaces have been released since then, but none have gained as much traction as Jupyter Notebooks have. Starting in the early 2000s, open-source scientific tools were becoming more and more popular and with the widespread popularity of Jupyter, it's well on its way to becoming a standard for sharing research methodology and results."

    "## Why (Jupyter) Notebooks?\n",
    "Notebooks are used for [*literate programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), a programming paradigm introduced by [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) in 1984, in which a programming language is accompanied with a documentation language, or a natural language. In other words, the computer program has an explanation in a natural language. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to programming effectively treats software as works of literature ([Knuth](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf), \"Literate Programming\"). _It supports people to have a strong conceptual map of what is happening in the code and also to have clarity on the flow and logic of the code/program, which is helpful for both the writer and the reader_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter leverages this idea and enables users to create and share documents that combine code, visualizations, narrative text, equations, and rich media. Notebooks are multipurpose and can be used in any discipline. The notebook is like a laboratory notebook, but for computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers can write code to work with their data while supplementing their methods with explanations, analysis, or hypotheses. Notebooks are also used in education because they enable students to engage with content presented in different forms, experience computation with no prior experience, and practice programming in a scaffolded way.
