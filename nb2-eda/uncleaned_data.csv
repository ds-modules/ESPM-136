However, there are some gaps. UPS stood out as the disruptor when comparing the two companies as they have more dramatic changes in progress (such as the VTOL's).
UPS lacked strategies on how they work directly with their large consumers such as Walmart and Albertsons. With large consumers like those, there are possibilities for improvement and collaboration to possibly create a central drop-off facility or grouped deliveries to limit travel-based emissions. 
FedEx on the other hand did not mention anything about working directly with individual customers to offer carbon-reduced shipping options, possibly giving up more convenient shipping, but allowing for grouped shipments or reduced mileage. UPS has proved that this works and reduced 298,000 metric tonnes of carbon in their first year. If FedEx implements this, they could see similar effects.

This is a smaller percentage compared to the other company I have been researching, however Cargill was producing a lot more carbon than Nestle so this is still a great goal for them to have. ","I could not find a concrete date and target that Cargill had published in terms of renewable energy.  However, cargill has built a large wind farm that is expected to power over 90% of their grid-based electrical power.  The company expects to build more farms in the near future.  ","Investing in wind powered technologies for ships that can cut down on 20-30% of fuel usage.  ","The company has methanol fueled cargo ships set to debut in 2025.  They are also working on biodiesel fuel to power other cargo ships.  Their transportation is one of the largest carbon emissions in their company.  ","The company has been investing millions into biodiesel production.  This is something that has not been used in the industry yet so this investment is sort of a gamble.  If the research were to pay off, then they would be able to maintain powerful fuel that is also cleaner for the environment.  ","Cargill is pushing to reduce green house gas emissions in beef supply chain by 30% by 2030.  The beef industry is a very large producer of carbon emissions, so this decrease will have a great positive effect on the climate.  ","Nestle plans to hit net zero carbon emissions by 2050.","They plan to have 100% renewably sourced electricity company-wide by 2025.","Nestle is creating a system to recycle & reuse their water, also monitoring amounts of discharged waste water in order to hold themselves accountable and cut back on this amount. ","The company is adopting sustainable transportation & currently working on hydrogen powered trains in a larger number of areas worldwide.  ","The company is investing in reusable and refillable options for consumers.  This innovation would be a huge long-term investment to ultimately get rid of a need for packaging altogether.  Zero packaging for a food company like Nestle would be amazing and would safe on a huge number of plastic waste. ","Nestle is enforcing that all suppliers be completely deforestation free by 2025.  The company is also working on 100% of their ingredients being sources sustainably by 2030, which would include the resources from their supply chain. ","Cargill still has a lot of opportunities to improve their sustainability efforts.  While they are working on all areas in their company (including transportation, land, water, human rights), there is still a lot of room for growth.  The company has made targets to improve their sustainability but many of them are pretty small, especially in comparison to other disruptors to the industry.  The company could definitely work on sustainable packaging as well as animal rights.  I did not see much of an attempt to improve the quality of life of the animals in their industry, neither did I see an attempt to create more sustainable or recyclable packaging for their products. 
Nestle on the other hand could work to make refillable/reusable resources for their products available to more of their consumers.  Right now it seems refillable products are only available in certain areas, and this innovation would be key to reducing plastic waste in this company.  It’s also important for them to make the customer aware of these resources so they can become more widely accepted and used.

","With lime and cement activities accountable for 77% of CRH's energy use, the company is 'continuously driving energy efficiency and have developed programs to improve energy performance'. ","CRH's main adoption of low-carbon technologies, is using low-carbon wastes and by-products that are being sourced from other industries. These low-carbon raw materials are a key component to further reducing CRH's carbon footprint. They use a total of 8.4 million tonnes of alternative raw materials in their cement plants as of 2022.

This initiative consisted of reduction to office plastic waste, increase of recycling, switching company cars to electric vehicles, and switching to greener electricity sources. Outside of their corporate offices, Holcim has asses 48% of their quarries using the Biodiversity Indicator Reporting System, and has worked to lower the total level of freshwater with drawl used annually. ","Holcim is accelerating efforts in decarbonization through increased use of alternative raw materials, clinker factor and alternative fuels, as well as the implementation of ""next-generation technology projects"". ","Holcim just missed their 100% target by 2022, by achieving 95% increase of qualification of high-ESG-risk suppliers. Additionally, they implemented their supplier due diligence process in 100% of their countries. This has established their due diligence as a minimum control standard while working to further improve the process. ","While CRH is beginning to utilize alternative fuels as a source of energy in their cement sector, their extensive research into cost efficiency and environmental benefit is not shown in their efforts. Not only is the burning of fossil fuels environmentally damaging, but it is a financial burden as CRH has to purchase carbon offsets to account for the emission created. Burning biomass as an alternative fuel is a direct low cost opportunity, and is an adequate source of heat to ensure the optimal production of CRH products. With Scope 1 emissions being their largest emission source, reducing carbon emissions from production would greatly increase sustainability within CRH. 

Holcim Ltd. prides itself off their extensive line of sustainable and innovative building materials, but also lacks a representation of recycled material. While certain types of their cement have up to 20% of recycled material within it, the company could improve waste and their circular economy model by increasing the amount of recycled materials they use within their products. In both the CDP report, and company sustainability report, Holcim briefly touches on their use of recycled aggregates for the development of their products, but does not elaborate on the percentage used, or its impact on their sustainability.

H&M has high direct emissions, but even higher indirect emissions totaling 8,296,196 metric tons of CO2. With the ambitious goal of 100% renewable energy by 2030, H&M would benefit its sustainability efforts by ramping up carbon emissions reductions to achieve net zero before 2040. Reducing indirect emissions would need action in tackling emissions from both purchased energy and associated activities. Strategies to achieve this include further investing in renewable energy, growing circularity within their products and materials, and creating stricter climate and carbon regulations for suppliers. 

The RealReal has very low direct and indirect carbon emissions compared to H&M. Despite their strong climate action plans, The RealReal may benefit from committing to a renewable energy goal to accelerate their plan of achieving net zero by 2050. This can be achieved by investing in renewable energy technologies through signing power purchase agreements or buying power from renewable sources.

Looking at their ""annual ESG report"", I am certainly skeptical of their carbon reporting data because their scope 3 emission is reported to be about the same as their scope 1/2. However, common knowledge about their company might disagree with their self-reported data because the majority of their emissions should be coming from Scope 3. Given that there clearly lacks universal standards for carbon accounting in all three scopes, companies take advantage of their liberty in accounting for their emissions. Even though Scope 3 emissions are hard to account for, one thing that IBM can definitely improve on is their carbon accounting. One company needs to fully account for their carbon before they could strategize about reducing their emissions. IBM has much to learn from Microsoft as Microsoft is in the process of developing scope 3 carbon calculator. While IBM's overall reluctance to change in undeniable, I believe it is understandable because their total revenue is a small percentage of Microsoft's, meaning them less likely to spend as much money in R&D or disrupting their own operations and product designs to reduce carbon. However, having less money available for investing should not deter IBM from investing in clean energy. Many new investments in clean energy have proven to be profitable. 

Microsoft's Environmental Sustainability Report has impressed and surprised me as it presents many leading technologies and innovations that are bold and experimental. Their commitments to addressing Scope 3 emissions are impressive while their strategies are very inspiring because they have actually tried to switch cargo transport from high carbon intensive to low carbon intensive transports. Their first aviation transport option running on alternative fuel is hopefully going to change global supply chain transport. However, one thing I wished they had more clarity on was their carbon emissions and total amount of investment in carbon reduction and energy efficiency. Their reporting on three sectors' carbon emissions was inconspicuous, hidden in tiny fonts as illustrations on a graph. Their emissions are certainly way higher than IBM, and I suspect that is why they emphasize on their progress and commitments to carbon reduction without actually mentioning their actual emission number. However, I also felt that the impacts of their efforts to reduce carbon emissions were marginal. They claimed to have reduced total emissions by 0.5% while the business grew 18%. It means that they might have prioritized their growth and profit gains and failed their promise of ""pollute less by consuming less"". All their investments in clean tech seemed comprehensive, innovative, and disruptive, but the actual impact seemed trivial. One thing that Microsoft should improve on is to conduct more resource allocation studies on how they should devote their money and attention to create more actual, influential carbon reductions.

Shell's CDP report lists five absolute emission reduction projects and ten intensity emission reduction projects in 2022. Some emissions reduction projects include storing emissions from an upgrader in Canada and eliminating gas flaring by 2025. Carbon reduction plans are wordy and vague. ","CDP reports Shell's plans to replace routine flaring by using renewable energy to power oil and gas extraction. Claims to have partnered with Microsoft and shares their goal of achieving 100% renewable energy by 2025. This claim on CDP uses indirect language and does not include an action plan to achieve this lofty goal.

CDP reports make general statements about collaborating with suppliers and contractors to increase efficiency and reduce emissions."," Iberdrola's personal sustainability report shows their goal of reaching carbon neutral scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and net 0 by 2040. Iberdrola has one absolute emissions reduction target and three intensity emissions reduction targets in its CDP report for 2022. The absolute emissions reduction project consists of a 75 billion ERU investment from 2020-2025 in decarbonization solutions, green hydrogen, smart products, and heat pumps. Two of the three intensity emission reduction targets restate the same goals listed for their absolute target emission project.","Iberdrola's personal sustainability report describes a 37 billion euro investment in renewable energy from 2023-2025, 27 billion on grids and 17 billion on renewables. Iberdrola is a world leader in the renewable energy market.  ","CDP reports that Iberdrola has invested in the development of high-efficiency solar panels that minimize losses in high temperatures.

","Iberdrola has invested tens of billions of euros in renewable energy development and implementation, CDP reports. 75 billion ERU investment from 2020-2025 in decarbonization solutions, green hydrogen, smart products, and heat pumps. Additional investment in decarbonization is Iberdola's Tree Progamme. The objective is to plant 2.5 million trees by 2022 for the purpose of carbon capture.  ","Iberdrola engages its supply chain by running a campaign to educate suppliers about climate change, CDP reports. Iberdrola incentives supplier's climate change performance with award schemes.","One thing Shell can do to improve its sustainability efforts is setting ligament renewable energy targets and creating action plans to meet its goals. Currently, Shell’s renewable energy target aims to use renewable energy to continue powering oil and gas extraction. Shell should begin to make substantial investments to transition towards renewable energy given that regulations on fossil fuel power will continue to become stricter. Shell has been enormously profitable with its current fossil fuel energy production model but with the renewable transition underway, in the long run, refusing to invest in renewables will do Shell more harm than good.

Iberdrola can increase sustainability by focusing efforts on reducing carbon emissions rather than planting trees to balance emission and achieve carbon neutral targets. Iberdrola is a big player in the renewable energy transition but they could increase sustainability efforts creating concrete plans to achieve carbon reduction targets. With scope 1 and 2 emissions coming to a grand total of 17,402,408 metric tons CO2e in 2022, reaching a carbon neutral goal by 2030 is going to require an actionable plan.

Amcor should prioritize increasing transparency regarding its use of renewable energy in production facilities. While they may already be using renewable energy sources, sharing concrete data and progress on transitioning to renewable energy can demonstrate their commitment to reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, Amcor should prioritize investments in renewable energy infrastructure and actively embark on the transformation of their production processes to substantially augment the proportion of renewable sources. It is notable that while Amcor has made commendable strides in improving its operations, boasting a 146% increase in renewable energy use compared to FY21, there is an evident deficiency in both the CDP report and the company's sustainability report, where specific data and information regarding the energy sources for material production within its factories remain conspicuously absent.


Smurfit Kappa:
While Smurfit Kappa has a commendable focus on circularity and the use of recycled raw materials, they could further improve their sustainability efforts by placing greater emphasis on recycling their own materials through more sustainable methods. This can include investing in innovative recycling technologies and closed-loop systems within their own operations to minimize waste and maximize the reuse of materials. By expanding their circular approach beyond raw material procurement and material sourcing to encompass their own materials, Smurfit Kappa can significantly enhance its sustainability impact and reduce its environmental footprint.

In the recent years, H&M has made notable progress in its improvement towards sustainability efforts. However, at its core H&M is fast-fashion. Some opportunities for further enhancement include a recycling infrastructure, public traceability, supply chain ethical standards, setting a true carbon price and reducing overproduction. 

One big this H&M should focus more on is a circular economy/initiatives. Aligning with the main disruptor's of the fashion industry, it addresses countless sustainability issues while reducing waste, lowering carbon emissions, and conserving resources. Transitioning from a ""take-make-dispose"" model to a sustainable recyclable-reusable model is not only essential, but needed. 




REFORMATION:
From the get-go, Reformation has disrupted the fashion industry with sustainability incorporations at every level of the Multi-Level Perspective. However, that isn't to say they are perfectly carbon-free. Some opportunities for enhancement include reducing overproduction, limiting water-use and waste, fabric sourcing (locally), and textile waste recycling.

One big they they can focus on is the transparency and traceability in their overseas factories. While they emphasize their domestic locations (LA), Reformation like any other operates outside of the US and not in the most sustainable ways. Knowledge hubs and transparency reports would allow Reformation to hold themselves accountable to sustainability world-wide.

The first company I examined, Reformation, is a women's apparel brand based out of Los Angeles, CA. I was particularly intrigued in choosing Reformation because of their reputation for being a highly environmentally consensus and sustainable brand. Reformation takes pride in its sustainability efforts and is constantly setting new emission and carbon reduction goals. The most prominent sustainable practices at Reformation include a circular business model, sustainable sourcing, low impact fabrics & material, low energy and few factories, resource efficiency, to name a few. Reformation claims to source all of their clothing out of factories in Los Angeles which is a key contributor to their sustainability efforts. However, I did some digging on their website and found that they have multiple outsourcing factories, including many in South America and Asia. They state to have ""full transparency"" and take accountability for their actions, but you can only find this information if you take time to dig on their website. I believe Reformation could do a much better job at being honest with customers whilst trying to sell their image of sustainability. 
          The second company I examined was a company called Hennes & Mauritz AB, or more commonly known as H&M. H&M is a much larger brand than Reformation, as they sell their items in over 25+ countries, and have a annual revenue over 100x more than Reformation. H&M is known as a ""fast fashion"" brand, meaning they engage in an incredibly fast business cycle, with unethical sourcing and low quality material that is not made to last. As I was looking into the sustainability report submitted by H&M, I wasn't seeing many numbers or data, but rather promises and goals made by the brand. For example, in a 2022 Sustainability Disclosure, H&M hopes of shifting towards a circular business model where materials used to manufacture garments are biodegradable and reusable and made to last, however they mention nothing about shifting towards biodegradable materials or investing in low impact, durable materials. Although H&M has made some strides towards a more sustainable future, they still operate under a fast fashion, unsustainable business model. They have set multiple targets in emission reduction, but there appears to be no real action or strategies implanted in order to get there.","https://www.thereformation.com/sustainability-report.html","https://www.thereformation.com/sustainability/factories.html","https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/sustainability-reporting/","","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1xLENlrhf3hYK7IDFvTv5PBH5k3rSzUbA"

They can say that they are working on this, but it’s hard to believe when there is nothing supporting it. 

I think that Reformation should focus on their supply chain and create more concrete plans for their suppliers to reduce emissions. The company is already doing well with targeting other concerns, but this is the area where I feel like there is the most opportunity. While having a program may be great, there are no details on what the company is requiring their suppliers to do to lower emissions. They also don’t mention any incentives, so there are not that many reasons for the suppliers to reduce their emissions.

out a questionnaire to receive feedback. Doing so, helps them create new 
incentives and to see which supply chain to keep contracts with. ","It’s commendable, to say the least, that both Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corporation aim to achieve a more sustainable automotive industry, however, if we were to compare the two, Volkswagen AG has a more ambitious goal of cutting their emissions by 50.5% compared to Toyota Motor Corporation, falling 20% short. 

For Volkswagen AG, they should accelerate the transition to 100% renewable energy sources for their operations. Their current progress of using renewable energy sources for electricity and biofuels and transitioning their energy efficiency in production processes (motors and drives, compressed air, and cooling technology) and energy efficiency in buildings (building energy management systems, lighting, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning) has been significantly reducing their carbon footprint. If the corporation keeps up with this, it’ll also help align with its commitment to low-carbon energy consumption and stay within/below 1.5°C global warming temperatures. 


For Toyota Motor Corporation, the one big thing to focus on is setting more ambitious carbon reduction targets, especially in the context of vehicle emissions. They should aim for more aggressive goals to drive innovation and leadership in reducing vehicle emissions during driving compared to Volkswagen.

Additionally they have very low emissions, however, one thing I would like to see is more conversation about using renewable energy, renewables was not really talked about in their sustainability report nor in the CDP, I think this could further reduce their carbon emissions and show their support for the renewable industry. 

For H&M, one thing I really noticed when looking at their goals was that it seemed like they didn't want to go ""all in."" A lot of their goals were between 30-60% and their initiatives seemed like they were targeting smaller things that help reduce their emissions but not targeting the big issues, like manufacturing and materials. In addition they created 19 initiatives in 2022 but only 5 of them were actually started.

They educate their suppliers about climate change and promote energy efficiency.
Nike collects climate change and carbon information annually from its suppliers.
The company actively works with suppliers to set ambitious GHG reduction targets, implement energy efficiency measures, eliminate coal usage, and source renewable energy, indicating their intention to reduce their carbon footprint.","Nike is actively embracing low carbon technologies and sustainable energy sources to mitigate its carbon emissions. The company is primarily driving emissions reductions in its owned or operated facilities through the adoption of renewable electricity. They have accomplished this via power purchase agreements (PPAs) and onsite renewable energy installations. Office closures due to COVID-19 and energy efficiency initiatives have also contributed to emissions reductions.

However, Nike acknowledges an increase in Scope 1 carbon emissions due to facility expansion and the lack of scalable, lower carbon alternatives for natural gas and jet fuel. To counteract this, they are diligently pursuing energy efficiency opportunities and exploring options such as renewable natural gas and sustainable aviation fuel. They have even developed an internal sustainable fuels policy for consistency in decision-making.

In terms of Scope 2 emissions, Nike is making significant strides. They are actively working towards their goal of achieving 100% renewable electricity in their owned or operated facilities. Initiatives like the virtual power purchase agreement (vPPA) in Spain and various other PPAs and onsite solar projects have brought them to 78% of this target. Moreover, Nike is extending the use of onsite renewable energy at their distribution centers globally, showcasing their commitment to sustainable practices and reduced carbon emissions.","While Nike's efforts in decarbonization innovations are commendable, there are certain areas where a critique is warranted.

Firstly, although Nike is investing in renewable energy and exploring alternative fuels, the company's Scope 1 emissions are increasing due to facility expansion. This raises questions about the effectiveness of their sustainability efforts when it comes to scaling up operations. It's important for Nike to prioritize reducing emissions from their core activities.

Secondly, while the development of an internal sustainable fuels policy is a positive step, the details and transparency of this policy need to be made public. Stakeholders, including consumers and investors, often seek clear, verifiable commitments to sustainability, and Nike could improve by providing more information about their long-term strategies and targets.

Lastly, while onsite renewable energy projects are valuable, the extent of their impact could be limited without a broader commitment to reducing emissions throughout their supply chain. A more holistic approach, including working with suppliers to improve their environmental practices, is necessary for a comprehensive decarbonization strategy.

In conclusion, Nike's decarbonization efforts are laudable, but there's room for improvement in terms of addressing Scope 1 emissions, increasing transparency, and taking a supply chain-wide approach to sustainability.","Seeking reduction in scope 3 emission and simultaneously seeking to bring value back to suppliers within the supply chain in regards to carbon reduction. ","35% CO2 emission reduction per year between 2017 and 2030, resulting in approx. 3% reduction per year.","In 2020, PUMA also set a 100% renewable electricity target for own operations and a 25% renewable energy for 2030","PUMA has invested in decarbonization innovation by implementing an internal carbon price of 73.4 € per metric ton of CO2, based on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). This pricing mechanism drives their sustainability strategy and 10FOR25 targets, aiding in prioritizing sustainable materials, increasing renewable energy usage, and engaging with suppliers to reduce emissions. It also enhances transparency and helps monitor progress in reducing their carbon footprint across the value chain.","PUMA SE's adoption of low-carbon technologies includes initiatives like waste-heat recovery, process optimization, and improved efficiency in their captive power generation system, aligning with their goal to replace conventional cars with alternative engines and reduce emissions.","
PUMA's long-term commitment to decarbonization initiatives is exemplified by their Science-based Target (SBT) and associated emissions reduction strategy, established in 2019 and aimed at the year 2030. In accordance with their defined long-term horizon, spanning 5 to 10 years, PUMA has demonstrated a steadfast dedication to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change impacts.

Furthermore, PUMA's Sustainability 10FOR25 targets, initiated in 2020 and extending until 2025, represent their medium-term approach, covering a 2 to 5-year horizon. These targets reflect their strategic focus on sustainability and carbon reduction over the next several years.

By defining these time horizons for climate change-related matters, PUMA has created a roadmap for their decarbonization initiatives. This strategic approach underscores their commitment to taking meaningful and sustained actions to combat climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize their environmental footprint. It highlights PUMA's proactive role in contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally responsible future for the next decade and beyond.","Through engagement and incentives for and within the supply chain. They provide training, support, and best practices on how to make credible renewable energy usage claims. ","
PUMA can enhance sustainability by implementing a circular business model. Firstly, they could prioritize product design for recyclability and durability, using eco-friendly materials. Secondly, they should establish efficient take-back and recycling programs, encouraging customers to return and recycle old products. Collaborating with suppliers to reduce waste and emissions throughout the supply chain is vital. PUMA can also invest in innovative technologies for recycling and repurposing materials. Furthermore, partnerships with other industry leaders and organizations focused on sustainability would promote knowledge sharing and drive industry-wide change. This holistic approach would align PUMA with circular economy principles, reducing waste, conserving resources, and fostering long-term sustainability. 
Nike could significantly enhance its sustainability efforts by focusing on a major reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within its supply chain. Implementing comprehensive strategies to minimize emissions at every stage of production, especially utilizing an internal carbon tax. This includes transitioning to renewable energy sources for manufacturing facilities, optimizing logistics to reduce carbon-intensive transportation, and encouraging suppliers to adopt greener practices. Additionally, a robust carbon accounting system, with transparent reporting of emissions reduction progress, would help Nike track its impact effectively. Prioritizing GHG emissions reduction as a core sustainability goal would not only align with global climate objectives but also showcase Nike's commitment to being a leader in environmental responsibility.","https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&discloser_id=997302&locale=en&organization_name=NIKE+Inc.&organization_number=13279&program=Investor&project_year=2022&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F196463&survey_id=78646008","","https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&discloser_id=973096&locale=en&organization_name=PUMA+SE&organization_number=15345&program=Investor&project_year=2022&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F182180&survey_id=78646008","","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1qDm38I8eavN4f__FZqkAHeW8t-erVsbK"

Throughout the report Shell makes a point to show off all of their carbon capture projects such as Quest Carbon Capture and Storage and the Northern Lights Project in order to claim that they are sustainable. However, it is proven that carbon capture is ineffective. Shell is trying to avoid actually reducing carbon emissions in the first place.

I believe that Upfield could focus more on setting larger goals for carbon and emissions reduction. Because it is a leader in the sustainability field, it should it go above and beyond the baseline standards for carbon reduction, specifically to achieve it sooner and switch entirely to renewable energy. Their climate initiatives and goals are strong, but they can be taken a step further based on the progress they have previously made.

However, I am quite surprised to see how transparent they are and how their CDP report was easy to follow and not infused with a bunch of confusing jargon. Their Sustainability Report was very long but went into detail for every section. It is clear that they are putting a lot of effort in every sphere of sustainability and decarbonisation and that they are collaborating and cooperating with a lot of other organizations. They have clear action plans and speak about its progress. I think it can mention some of its failures rather than all its successes. It would be interesting to read more about some things that they had tried and implemented, like a certain program, but did not actually end up working and why. Would it be something they will continue to work on or ditch entirely and move onto something else? We see what is working but what isn't? They do a good job at listing what they are working on, their progress and their learnings (what I am referring to) but it would be cool to see more of that. I also like that they talk about addressing greenwashing solutions, such as using recycled content. They mention how mono v blended materials are better and the challenges that go with that change. I am surprised to see this because most fashion brands boast about using recycled content, even though it can be more damaging than non recycled materials. They also have a systems approach to their solutions, rather stating all of the good they are doing. These disruptive innovations are entirely ready for the fashion system that has already been put in place, and they talk about their experience with adapting to an existing system.

Inditex is one the biggest fast fashion groups in the world, its brands include Zara, Bershka, Resto, Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home, and Uterqüe. Their sustainability report can be summarized as “just starting out” for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is more focused on product development. There is a lot of talk on proposing programs, initiatives and developing action plans but it appears that there is no outstanding evidence that Inditex has been on track to meeting its goals. There is a big emphasis on reducing the amount of energy they consume and transitioning to renewable energy but the only clear steps they have on achieving this is by using their own solar, wind, and some geothermal energy. Overall, it is clear that they anticipate working towards change but they are just in the beginning stages, which means they don't have a lot of data to show. They compensate for this by throwing in a jargon amount of initiatives and collaborations they plan on doing but dont go into detail about what these really mean. Most of what they state is very vague and gives very little value. However, their product side and goal towards circularity seems to hold more promise. They give more mention to other company names and foundations to work towards technology for textile recycling.

The company has made targets to reduce its scope three emissions by utilizing wholesale buying and selling natural gas. This should achieve a 90% reduction between 2018-2040. This highlights a move towards phasing out natural gas. They are closing their coal-based CHP plant by 2023 at the latest. In 2021, they began working with the Gambian government on a mangrove conservation and reforestation project as a carbon sequestering system. This will be further highlighted below. ","Their power consumption comes mainly from offshore wind farms. Their emissions come from supply chain issues and lingering natural gas use which will be highlighted further below.","They plan to reduce emissions from their offshore logistics by working efficiently, including route optimizations and sailing at fuel-saving speeds. ","They are aiming to have a fully electric car fleet by 2025. As of this sustainability report, 51 % is electric (including plug-in hybrids), up from 41 % last year.","They're working on growing carbon removal projects to ensure any residual emissions are offset. They're investing in sustainability through ecosystem-based carbon removal projects referenced previously in their CDP report. The company has launched a five-year global partnership with the World Wide Fund for Nature to set biodiversity protection and restoration standards for offshore wind development.","The company works to reduce its emissions through its supply chain and wholesale buying and selling of natural gas.
They aim to reduce value chain emissions of renewable energy by lowering GHG emissions intensity of 2.9 g CO2e/kWh. This allows them to continue to grow their renewable energy business while working with the renewable industry to bring down emissions throughout the lifetime of renewable energy assets.
They launched a supply chain decarbonization program in 2020, which engages suppliers in the manufacturing and installing renewable energy assets. These are chosen because of their high CO2 emissions and high spending. 
They have a net zero emissions target across their entire supply chain by 2040. 
Through the above program, they will use measures to assess success in their supply chain, some of which are only renewables in manufacturing by 2025, and optimize their vessel fleet with a roadmap to develop power vessels with renewable energy. 
In 2021, 97% of strategic suppliers used 100% green electricity, and 15% have committed to doing so by 2025. 
They require suppliers to develop roadmaps to transition to green energy with optimized short-term solutions, like sustainable biofuels and optimizing transit routes. A central area that was referenced in their CDP report and continued in their sustainability report is the decarbonization of their supply chain. This is program one and aims to meet a net zero target by 2040. They have utilized asset-specific life cycle assessments of their offshore assets in their scope three reporting. They've established a joint industry program with other energy groups to develop emission measurement standards. The progress made in this program includes above 90% of their suppliers disclosing emissions data to the CDP, with 40% having set or committed to science-based targets. More than 69% have adopted 100% renewable electricity or committed to doing so by the end of 2025. 
Steel represents 50% of their supply chain emissions from offshore assets, so using scrap steel as a short-term solution until innovation allows for zero-emission steel. They have similiar goals to move towards low-emission concrete. They show the most leadership in their supply chain goals. They are focused on tackling emissions tied to their value chain to meet net zero by 2040. They will be tracking carbon progress on lifestyle cycle assessments of emissions, engaging suppliers that are the most carbon-intensive of their supply chain, and through this, they are helping these suppliers set science-based targets, report their emissions accurately, move to 100% renewable energy by the end of 2025, optimize vessel routes and develop roadmaps to meet these goals. Further leadership in this arena is highlighted through their cross-sector collaboration to aid other leading companies in their decarbonization strategies. ","They aim to be carbon neutral in their emissions by 2040. 
Aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 10.17 million tons in fiscal 2030, compared to fiscal 2009. They want to accomplish this by pursuing energy conservation measures in business activities and pursuing sales and development of environmentally friendly products, including renewable energy. They also seek environmentally conscious businesses and contribute to developing a low-carbon, recycling-oriented society.
They have a goal to reduce customer CO2 emissions by 1.8 million tons through the sale and development of products such as lubricants that improve fuel efficiency, ETBE-blend gasoline, hydrogen, and renewable energy.
They aim to achieve carbon neutrality by reducing emissions by the equivalent of 16 million tons by 2040.
 Claims that 1/3 of their reductions will come from existing energy conservation initiatives at refineries and plants, promoting environmentally friendly products, and CCUS.","The company acquired Japan Renewable Energy Corporation (JRE) in 2021. With the inclusion of JRE's projects under development and the acquisition of the power generation capacity of 1 GW, there are no initiatives stated in the CDP on how they contributed most to this.
The CDP states there is no overarching initiative for emissions reductions. Their only targets seem to be set through acquiring the Japan Renewable Energy Corporation and their renewable energy generation capacity.  ","They want to pursue energy conservation by introducing automated operations at refineries and smelters.
Claims that 1/3 of reductions will come from technological innovations such as e-fuel and the pursuit of new emerging businesses. ","Aim to pursue EV and other aspects of the mobility business. 
Their metals division has an interim target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50% by FY2030 compared to FY2018. One major initiative is pursuing CO2-free electricity in all JX Nippon Mining & Metals Group business areas.
They've opened four new hydrogen stations, participated in multiple projects that evaluated commercial viability and technological development, and conducted verification trials on a future supply chain of green hydrogen.   
They are working on an outline for a route-charging business using their nationwide network of  13,000 service stations, charging services in homes, and expanding related services such as EV leasing, sharing, and maintenance.","The company plans to entirely cut its emissions following the decline in domestic demand and pursue renewable energy, CO2-free hydrogen, and CCS and CCUS. 
They are conducting several demonstration projects, including constructing a CO2-free hydrogen supply chain. The government's Green Innovation Fund has adopted this and is developing technologies in collaboration with the government.
They have set an annual 1% reduction rate emission target for each business segment where emissions occur due to business activities.
We conduct a sensitivity analysis by in-house carbon pricing as a reference value in making decisions on investment.
They participate in public-private councils, which aim to promote the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The company is conducting a feasibility study to produce sustainable aviation fuel at our Negishi Refinery.
JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration is a CCS Long-Term Roadmap Committee member, and ENEOS participates as an observer. CCS is part of the Japanese government's Sixth Strategic Energy Plan.
They have started operations at three more mega solar power plants built on idle land in Japan.
The carbon-free fuels are alternatives to petroleum products made from hydrogen derived from renewable energy and CO2. These synthetic fuels are almost the same as petroleum products. The entire supply chain, including existing refineries, storage and transport facilities, and service stations, can be repurposed, and the fuels can be used as aviation and automotive fuels without modification.
They are meeting the rising demand for bio jet fuel in the future by conducting a commercialization review of sustainable jet fuel manufacturing using waste, including waste plastics, as part of our efforts to build a supply system for CO2-free fuel.","There is a lack of work in their supply chain to support a zero-carbon transition. Still, they stated in their sustainability report that as restrictions from the government tighten, their management of  CO2  in the supply chain will potentially become more rigorous. There is a possibility that securing and utilizing raw materials for recycling, which emit less CO2, will be highly evaluated by the market, including consumers. This seems vague and doesn't appear as extreme dedication to this goal.","
I chose both energy companies; Orsted represents the disruptor, and JX Nippon is the incumbent. Orsted exemplifies how an energy company should be built to withstand shocks, protect the environment, maintain a stable supply chain, and strengthen the capacity to continue moving towards complete decarbonization and, ultimately, a fully sustainable business design. My only critique is that they must invest in more than nature-based carbon removal solutions to mitigate emissions. They could do more to invest in CCS and innovative renewable energy solutions like green hydrogen production and the research and development needed to utilize it at scale. We need solutions like this to help shorten the use of fossil fuels while transitioning. Carbon sequestration is essential, but funds in research and development to fix the kinks in renewable energy that are currently halting our full adoption are necessary for our transition and to meet the 1.5C goal. 

JX Nippon outlines well how they plan to contribute to the renewable energy transition, but there needs to be more clarity in how they plan to move out of oil and gas and into renewables. They are investing heavily in positive climate innovation, but explicit commitments to stop drilling and working in fossil fuels are needed.

","They do not specify a renewable energy target and date ","They plan on implementing three different programs for carbon reduction. Their first program is low-carbon energy generation from solar photo voltaic cells. They also propose lowering their carbon energy consumption through a mixture of low carbon electricity that includes use of wind, fuel cell, solar, cogeneration technologies, and energy storage. Their third proposed initiative relates to the category of waste reduction and material circularity through recycling of products/components/materials which is interesting because there products are lettuce ","n/a","n/a","They are participating in project gigaton. Engaging in this project could  increase supply chain efficiency through innovation in data science tools. Field-in is an example of this and has helped with real-time decision making as well as forecasting, helping with overall efficiency in optimization of the supply chain management. Accurate tools for forecasting and decision making within the supply chains could help reduce food waste significantly. ","They have committed to reducing green house gas emissions 10 % by 2025 and 30 % by 2030","They did not specify a specific renewable energy target and date. ","Newly implemented actions include electrification of production infrastructure, recovering wasted heat from in production (thermal fuels), low carbon installations. All these changes support a lower intensity metric. They also plan on sourcing energy from renewable energy purchases including sourcing energy from the Crocker Wind Farm. They also plan on implementing ISO50001 energy management standards to monitor and regulate sites and actively review and improve renewable energy efficiency. ","As a way to recycle bio materials from production, they created bio-based innovation Cargill’s Anova™ Asphalt Solutions which reduces green house emissions by 10% by providing a product that is disruptive to the asphalt industry. ","They do mention anticipated investment in a biofuel plant but there is not not much else mentioned about specific mechanisms they have already in use or anticipate implementing to reach decarbonization goals.  ","Cargill engages collaboratively with farmers on projects to maintain soil health and grazing management. They also are working on the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund that compensates farmers/acre for incorporating more sustainable farming practices like cover cropping, reduced tillage, and optimization of nutrient management. They also participate in Climate Food + Ag Dialogue to work with Federal actors to develop policy to define principles and key issues needed to be addressed to combat climate change in food and ag industries.","Taylor Farms demonstrates little committed to sustainability. They would benefit greatly from investment in low-carbon technologies in production such as electrifying vehicles used to transport produce or decarbonization of infrastructure used to process the produce in their plants. Generally they need more commitment to reducing their emissions through more research and development and institutional organization around the management of their sustainable strategy. These actions would help ensure the alignment of their company operations with their commitment to sustainability. Their current commitments to sustainability imply greenwashing and investment in renewable energy with no clear organizational and internal regulatory pathways to meet their goals.  

Cargill demonstrates a commitment to sustainability. They would benefit from innovative, decarbonizing technologies that could function within their production and distribution systems. It is promising to learn about their bio-based asphalt innovation that recycles used bio-material and residue as well as their carbon market initiatives with small farmers that pay farmers to improve grazing management, soil health, and carbon sequestration. They must transition their infrastructure and systems internally with decarbonizing technology instead of relying on carbon market collaborations and purchasing renewable energy to sustain current infrastructure and systems that are unsustainable.

A company that was once based on fossil fuels has done a full 180, something Conoco Phillips can and should consider doing based on the company's purchasing power. However, considering their efforts to lobby lawmakers, switching off fossil fuels seems unlikely. They should make their operations more efficient by patching methane leaks and using more recycled oil to limit their emissions. Additionally, their efficiency can be improved through streamlining processes and limiting the use of freshwater. The company will need to eventually pivot to renewable energy if it wants to survive the latter half of the century. 

Orsted has less work to do but can still streamline its renewable operations to achieve its 2025 goal. The company will need to ease off its roots more aggressively. Orsted was ordered by Danish authorities to continue operations at some oil and coal-fired plants last winter which shows a lack of renewable energy independence in the company. As they move to stronger goals, they need to retire their old plants indefinitely to be sustainable.","https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&discloser_id=942698&locale=en&organization_name=ConocoPhillips&organization_number=3751&program=Investor&project_year=2022&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F210375&survey_id=78646008","","https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&discloser_id=973733&locale=en&organization_name=%C3%98rsted&organization_number=30215&program=Investor&project_year=2022&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F205992&survey_id=78646008","","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1RKXHQm2qQV3yodNmzyCKtFrwluLS947s"

In my research I discovered that the financial disruptor is actually more than a century old, but only transitioned to a digital banking company which took off in the 2000s. As a disruptor, Ally is familiar with looking ahead, so it’s concerning that they have little to no investments in decarbonization technology. The extent of their investment in low-carbon technology only goes as far as setting a goal to make 30%+ of their real estate portfolio (remember, they operate 0 brick-and-mortar branches, only corporate buildings) LEED certified. Therefore, they are in dire need of investing into decarbonization innovation themselves, to get ahead of the game.

J.P.Morgan Chase and Co. is doing surprisingly well in most carbon reduction opportunity areas. What emissions they have not been able to mitigate, they “make up for” (depending on who you ask) by purchasing supposedly high-quality carbon credits and applicable EACs. Where they can most improve is in the supply chain. Currently they have 3 programs which: 
1. Educate suppliers on how they can “integrate positive environmental practices,”
2, Conduct a third-party sustainability assessment of the top 850 suppliers in order to establish future baselines, and
3.Create a “financial institution consortium” to provide a forum for industry best practices respectively. 
These programs look nice on paper but are weak and ultimately futile in practice. Unless JPMorgan and Co. sets supplier standards for itself, the supply chain will continue to be wasteful and inefficient.

- I think it worth mentioning that Southern Company also actively engages with policy-makers, trade associations, and non-profits","- Intensity Reduction Target (emissions targets are relative to an economic variable)
- this is a company wide reduction target - set in 2021 - for Scope 1 and 2 emissions with a base year of 2020 (emissions of .188 metric tons CO2e per megawatt hour (MWh))
- target year of 2035 to reduce emissions by 70% to a level of .0564 metric tons CO2e per unit of activity

- they also engage indirectly with trade unions ","
 The Southern Company is an incumbent firm in the utility sector; providing electricity generated from primarily natural gas and coal. Although they are diversifying their assets through investment in renewables and phasing out of coal, the Southern Company needs to vastly improve their focus on energy efficiency. With what I'd imagine is billions of dollars of sunk costs in natural gas producing infrastructure, I think it would be quite difficult for this corporation to fully transition away from fossil fuel based energy. Therefore, energy efficiency will be the largest factor in reducing Southern Company's GHG emissions by investing in energy efficiency R&D, providing more opportunities for consumers, and specifying key steps for future implementation of energy efficient infrastructure. 
 Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure PLC, the disruptor firm, focuses on building and acquiring assets rooted in renewable energy production and sustainability. They must begin to improve their relationships with policy makers. Incumbent firms have a great understanding of how to work with elected officials and NGOs who directly influence policies that can support or hurt their business. Atlantica gaining influence within the realm of policy formation would enable them to gain a strong foothold in the infrastructural economic sector, create a more welcoming environment for similar companies to thrive, and demonstrate to incumbent firms that renewable energy is a viable source of profits.

There is no specific date set, or quantity reduction target named. They are planning on introducing a target in the coming couple of years.","Arkay offsets their GHG emissions through the purchase of Green-e Energy certified renewable energy credits and carbon offsets. All carbon offsets are purchased through Natural Capital Partners. The offsets fund the Seneca Meadows Landfill Project which captures and destroys methane from landfill gas (LFG) while also creating almost 420 acres of new wetlands and generating electricity from the LFG to power 18,000 homes.","Arkay has not stated that they are adopting any low-carbon technologies at this time.","Arkay is planning on using more reusable materials for packaging to meet consumers' demands on sustainability. In the long-term, Arkay plans on renovating their facilities and equipment to lower their GHG footprint.","In terms of sourcing materials, Arkay is certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) standards. SFI encourages sustsinabilty forestry practices by using third-party audits to ensure wood and paper products are sourced from well-managed forests. Additionally, 100% of Arkay’s contracted suppliers acknowledge the Supplier Code of Conduct & 50% of targeted suppliers complete Arkay’s Quality and ESG Supplier Questionnaire. Regarding end-of-life, Arkay partners with a local recycling management company that specializes in supporting the board converting industry to ensure that all the recyclable materials are reintroduced into the economy.","The Packaging Corporation of America should improve their sourcing of materials, and the renewability of their energy. Only 33 percent of first-use fiber comes from certified forests; PCA should work with the Sustainability Forest Inititative to source 100% of their wood and paper product materials from sustainably harvested forests. A point of pride in PCA’s report was their usage of natural gas, specifically how natural gas emits much less coal, which used to make up 10% of PCA’s portfolio in 2011. PCA should not view the transition to natural gas as a success, but rather keep striving to meet more ambitious energy targets. PCA generates much of their own energy, such with full-line plant boilers that combust natural gas, and they even subsidize natural gas for some rural communities. PCA should use their resources for a renewable energy transition, such as investing in solar grids and wind turbines, instead.

Arkay Packaging Corporation should set concrete goals and timelines for renewable energy targets and sustainable plant and appliance retrofitting. They should also set concrete goals for the percent of recycled materials that their products will incorporate, and by what year they will do this.","https://www.packagingcorp.com/filebin/pdf/ResponsibilityReports/PCA_2022_Responsibility_Report.pdf","https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&discloser_id=987901&locale=en&organization_name=Packaging+Corporation+Of+America&organization_number=28617&program=Investor&project_year=2022&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F185384&survey_id=78646008","https://www.arkay.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Arkay-2023-Sustainability-Report.pdf","https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=74241094&discloser_id=914656&locale=en&organization_name=ARKAY+PACKAGING+CORP&organization_number=851207&program=Investor&project_year=2021&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2021%2Fdbbr64mv%2F125731&survey_id=73557641","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1ib-GvlfiMM3Fp0kkW6bL5yan2OWQyMLO"

","As I read through H&M’s CDP report and Sustainability Report, I saw a pattern of vague targets and a lack of transparency. The brand often made claims that they would try to reach certain goals – such as 100% LED lighting in their offices and stores – but would either not offer a specific timeline or report insufficient action being taken. Additionally, I sensed a lack of complete transparency. The Sustainability Report specifically was just a lot of empty words to make up for the fact that the brand really is not doing much to reach its sustainability targets. They spoke as if their “Conscious” collection was ground-breaking and significant when, in reality, the brand, of course, still heavily follows the fast fashion model. H&M made claims that they are “working on” new technology, innovations, and materials to make their products more sustainable but, again, lacked specificity. H&M’s main issues are a lack of transparency and beefing up their insufficient progress and actions. The brand is one of the largest fast-fashion brands and is not taking sufficient steps to be more sustainable.

When reading the Reformation CDP report and Sustainability Report, I felt that the brand prioritized its transparency and did not try to “beat around the bush” when it came to reporting its progress and failures in becoming more sustainable. The brand has already adopted sustainable practices, as they are a Climate Neutral Certified brand, and provided clear goals when discussing their sustainability targets. The brand has focused largely on moving away from the usage of high-impact materials like conventional cashmere and was transparent when discussing failures in its search for alternatives. Despite the brand’s overall positive progress and targets, it still operates under the fast fashion model by releasing new products each month. Although the brand is more environmentally conscious than many other brands, the constant release of new products promotes over-consumption and contradicts the goals of being a sustainable brand. As the brand stated in its Sustainability Report, Reformation regularly uses high-impact materials like conventional cashmere and silk to make their clothing. Due to this, the constant release of new items, especially ones made of these materials, is something the brand should continue to move away from.

Their current projects are focused too much on using greenwashing to make it appear as though all technological innovations are decarbonization tactics when that is just not the case. They also really poorly describe the new protein sources and circular economy that they are looking to implement. Instead, they could look towards electrifying transportation and carbon capture. 

Although General Mills is doing a better job at decarbonizing, they need to be more clear in how they are going to spend the $3 MM annually for capital investment in utility efficiency projects. More pertinently, however, is that they need more clarity and planning on how they are going to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2030. While they describe two solar projects and two wind power virtual purchase power agreements, there is little detail on the structures of these projects and how they are going to make the entire corporation net zero. They will also need to add renewable energy structures to all aspects of the supply chain as well, so such a road map would be helpful in actualizing this goal.

• Participates in several trade associations that support broader advocacy goals related to the clean energy transition","As the largest investor-owned electric utility in the U.S., Duke Energy’s proclaimed investments in solar and wind energy are miniscule compared to its vast size. While the corporation has drastically reduced its coal/oil usage for power generation (from 60% in 2005 to 17% in 2022) due to EPA lawsuits, it has replaced its coal infrastructure with natural gas plants and pipelines. As we know, the extraction of natural gas relies on fracking, a major source of water and air pollution. Further, the transportation and burning of natural gas emits methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Duke’s current 2030 sustainability plans include further replacing their coal usage with natural gas extraction for power generation. Rather than doing so, the company should abandon its non-renewable funding altogether, diverting its efforts and funds into solar, wind, and biomass plants to support the Clean Energy Transition. 

Brookfield Renewable Energy, on the other hand, is a disruptor to the electric utility industry, avoiding approximately 33 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2022. In fact, in 2020, Brookfield set a goal to double its avoided CO2 emissions by 2030. While Brookfield’s hydro, wind, and solar assets remain one of the largest in the world, the renewable energy market is rapidly expanding, requiring aggressive expansion and generation to meet upcoming demand. For this reason, Brookfield should focus on expanding their energy plants and diversifying their portfolio to include investments in tidal, geothermal, and biomass energy generation.","https://p-cd.duke-energy.com/-/media/pdfs/our-company/esg/2022-impact-report.pdf?rev=3d15a7b22cea45e2a7e9a481bb445e00","","https://bep.brookfield.com/sites/bep-brookfield-ir/files/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2/bep-esg-2022.pdf","https://www.brookfield.com/responsibility/2022-sustainability-report","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1aer16ss8mBpKbCz6-322oCwz-5PF5ByW"

GE can certainly also put more energy into convincing customers who support the fossil fuel economy to move away from carbon. Their sustainable technologies, such as hydrogen blend powered turbines, are quickly becoming economically viable to transition too but people are slow to change, and a plan of how technologies were going to be sold to customers was absent from the sustainability report. 


Sustainability is at the core of First Solar’s company, committing themselves to set industry standards in sustainability and receiving an A- rating because of it. The one area where improvement is apparent to me is the issue of waste. First Solar has their own recycling facilities that are able to recover a large majority of waste material from old solar panels and have advanced systems for managing waste water that is created through the manufacturing process, but, these systems are not perfect and a goal/outline relating to reaching zero-waste by perfecting these systems would make First Solar even more compelling.

- Collaborate with renowned entities such as MIT to advance in textile recycling process and technologies, such as finding new methods for separating fibers and subsequent recycling, to achieve their circular economy strategic goal
- Investment in renewable energy generation facilities such as thermal solar, photovoltaic and wind energy facilities. In specific, the Outer Port Wind Facility in A Coruña project aims to generate on-site the renewable energy necessary to cover the annual electricity demanded by the headquarters
- Investment in R&D projects to eliminate all plastics to consumers, and recycle all materials used by the Group in the operations","The company trains the supply chain through projects where they analyze supply chain's will and need for technical assistance to achieve their sustainability goal.

Also, they have a code of conduct for suppliers and manufactures to make sure that all suppliers and manufacturers are in compliance with their sustainability standards, which includes mandatory social, environmental, and product health and safety requirements.

Moreover, they collaborate with suppliers and manufacturers to enhance the use of renewable energy, and promote circularity by reusing and recycling garments and fibers in supply chain.","For this assignment, I have selected American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO) as a large incumbent firm and Inditex as a sustainability “disruptor” firm in the apparel & footwear industry. This selection was based on the CDP score for their Climate Change 2022 report, where American Eagle Outfitters Inc. and Inditex received a B and A, respectively.

To further improve their sustainability efforts, American Eagle Outfitters Inc. should prioritize investment in innovative research and development focused on renewable energy. Currently, the company is struggling to meet their renewable energy target, and therefore must directly invest in developing large-scale renewable energy generation facilities, rather than merely installing solar panels or encouraging suppliers to use more renewable energy sources.

As for Inditex, the company has made significant progress by achieving 100% renewable electricity consumption in all facilities in 2022. Yet, they can also improve their sustainability efforts by scaling up the new decarbonization technologies to revolutionize the manufacturing process within the entire industry. For instance, by further developing the new CO2 capture technology that transforms CO2 into ethanol, which can be used to produce new materials like polyester, the company can achieve carbon neutrality or even carbon negativity.","https://www.aeo-inc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/09/AEO_2022ESGReport.pdf","https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&discloser_id=940210&locale=en&organization_name=American+Eagle+Outfitters+Inc.&organization_number=40188&program=Investor&project_year=2022&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F211662&survey_id=78646008","https://static.inditex.com/annual_report_2022/pdf/ENVIRONMENT.pdf","https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&discloser_id=942728&locale=en&organization_name=Inditex&organization_number=9031&program=Investor&project_year=2022&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F182001&survey_id=78646008","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1lsqhDCCP1eybhCamYgYEIYP2CySrRVfZ"

Currently, very little of their energy comes from renewable sources, and I believe IAG could strongly benefit from creating long-term renewable energy goals in order to start forming a path to both reduce their overall energy consumption and increase their renewable energy usage.

Moving to the incumbent Air France-KLM, they have also made moves towards the sustainability realm. While they have incorporated Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) their progress has been slower than that of IAG. One of these reasons could be linked to IAG’s collaboration with Microsoft in which they leveraged a high-travel company to fund the expansion of sustainable aviation. To increase their usage of SAF without necessarily bearing the expense, Air France-KLM could follow suit and collaborate with a large sustainably minded company that also utilizes their airline’s services.

Rather than adopting renewable solutions that are investing in “low-carbon projects” ","Climate info is collected annually from their suppliers. They categorize their engagement as incentivization in order to change the behavior of their suppliers. They spend more time collaborating with the suppliers who report the largest carbon emissions.
By putting investments into other forms of energy Shell intends to make it easier for their existing customers to make the change to more sustainable energy. They are funding the construction of EV charging stations in 28 countries and will continue to invest in alternate forms of energy as their currents investments are met with positive feed back from consumers. Shell has shifted their supply chain to include more power products besides oil, their reduction in Scope 3 emissions come from reduced sales in oil and increased revenue from power.

Many of their improvements are related to their actual operating facilities, offices, and buildings. Siemens developed a SF6 (a harmful GHG) free switch technology. This corp has plans to make their fleet of vehicles more efficient with a goal of 100% carbon neutral cars  by 2030.

Overall, Siemens is butting more of their budget toward R+D for low carbon project. This budget is not only going to new innovations but also the process of scaling up new energy transformation methods.","Climate and carbon info is collected annually from suppliers. Target agreements are made with suppliers who have the ability to meet those targets Siemens released a project that targeted the 100 highest carbon emitting suppliers and worked more closely with them directly to lower those numbers in line with Siemens standards. In an effort to better understand what areas need sustainability work, Siemens reached out to customers across industries to understand where heat waste could be improved and then create a plan to make those changes. Another team offers webinars and workshops for customers to learn about more sustainability initiatives.","While Shell has several investments in renewable energy production and has the intent to lower the impact of their existing facilities they still keep their oil drilling operations functional. Shell reported decommissioning some of their plants in favor of augmenting the carbon-saving technologies of others but this still does not solve the ultimate problem. Shell should work towards shutting down more of their oil production and, in turn, invest even more in renewable energy. 

Siemens has a lot of good projects that support a decrease in carbon emissions. However, they are in league with many outside suppliers. Currently, they have means in place to make sure that their suppliers meet their own sustainability criteria, and have even addressed the top 100 most problematic groups. Yet, there is obvious energy used in order to connect the products and services of these individual players with Siemens. It also seems unnecessary for Siemens to work with groups that have higher carbon emissions if they can create smaller-scale facilities that only need to fulfill their requirements. Siemens could cut down on the total energy consumption of transportation by moving to produce the goods of the third party on-site.

I will address my two greatest concerns: opposition to best-available science, and slow renewables transition. BP makes a large emphasis in the CDP disclosure about the definition of 'Science-Backed' and does not support the SBTi (backed by the UN, WWF, and CDP) and rather opts to define themselves as Science-Backed by their alignment with the Paris Agreement which is likely less restrictive. BP also does recognize the need for an energy transition and has plans to increase renewable energy generation, but while still continuing producing oil and gas. Their focus is on becoming an 'Integrated Energy Company' which implies the expansion to renewables while continuing oil and gas as well.

Regarding Ørsted, their pledges are quite a bit stronger and more ambitious than BP's and inherently have fewer emissions to combat in the first place due to their business model as a purely renewable energy producer. They have strong initiatives in place across their supply chain to hold suppliers accountable as well. I believe Ørsted could improve in the area of technological investment, seeing as they currently only invest in their own renewable technology (wind, solar PV, CCS).

Last year, Shell saved $225,000 and 372 metric tons of CO2 emissions simply by implementing waste management strategies. They also noted that the waste management initiative helped to increase energy efficiency and reduce power consumption. I think adopting a circular economy approach in Shell's sustainability plan is conducive to their other, more forefront energy initiatives, and they should continue this initiative longer than the 16-20 years noted in the report.
In NextEra's case, it is really great that they are helping to facilitate the US's transition to clean energies, especially solar. I would recommend that they consider and really prioritize environmental justice in their roll-out of large-scale solar.

Conagra Brands Inc. seems to have taken its climate responsibilities fairly seriously, although they have not achieved many milestones. Their commitment to reduce emissions by 25% by 2030 is not aggressive enough for a company of its size. Considering that agriculture is a major GHG emitter and the fact that Conagra is one of the largest snack food companies in the country, agriculture does not get enough attention in their sustainability report. It seems clear to me that transitioning to organic, regenerative, and local agriculture practices is the big goal they should seek to achieve.

Although Clif Bar is certainly not a new disruptor in the food industry, they seem to have a history of sustainable responsibility—even before their competitors were doing the same. Clif Bar has fairly aggressive reduction goals, aiming to reduce 50% of its scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030. Because the company has already reached some of its milestones, I think they should accelerate carbon reduction goals in two stages. First, they should focus on transitioning all their privately owned facilities to renewable energy, while also emphasizing efficiency changes to further conserve energy. The second stage would be to ramp up incentives for suppliers to lower their emissions and waste.

They have committed to all renewable or low-carbon energy by 2050, and they’ve proven to be well ahead of their benchmark goals along the way towards that goal. I do however think Ford could adopt a supply chain management system like Toyota. I didn’t see any mention of such a program for Ford, and that may be harder to implement in the large United States, but that would cut down emissions for sure. 

I think Toyota needs to step it up when it comes to reducing emissions via transitioning to EVs. Toyota is betting big on hydrogen fuel cells, which could totally pay off, but that really depends on finding clean ways to mass-produce hydrogen. Electricity production seems much easier to make renewable or low-carbon, so battery-powered EVs should be something Toyota looks into more. Toyota has also not made a strong renewable energy promise in general, and it seems to severely lack behind the promise of Ford.

Their current goal is to reduce GHG emissions intensity by 60% by 2030. Methods to achieve this goal include using recycled materials to reduce the production and sourcing of virgin (raw) materials, engaging with their supply chain to reduce the environmental footprint of the materials and services they buy, using less carbon-intensive materials and using water instead of electricity for cooling because it leads to lower climate change impacts, particularly in regions where water is plentiful.","Amcor plans to source renewable energy or have renewable energy installations on-site.

This is central to their decarbonization goals. No actual numbers were disclosed in the Sustainability Report.

EcoVadis helps Amcor evaluate each supplier’s performance in the areas of environment, labor practices and human rights, fair business practices, and procurement sustainability. Suplliers are then scored. Based on these scores, Amcor's procurement and sustainability teams assess whether additional interventions are necessary to reduce risk or use corrective action plans to further engage with the supplier on topics like labour practices, sustainability etc. Amcor's goal is for 75% of their strategic and critical suppliers to have completed an EcoVadis assessment within the past two years.","According to the CDP report, Helen of Troy's carbon reduction targets are fairly new (approved in 2022).

Helen of Troy has also strengthened supplier engagement through the amfori Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI),
CDP Supply Chain membership and on responsible chemical management.","While Amcor has implemented renewable energy sources into their activities, they still not have any actionable plans to incorporate renewable energy solutions into their supply chain. They don't indicate any type of implementation framework as well. i suggest that they dedicated time to coming up with Renewable Energy targets by their next Sustainability report. My next remark has more to do with the drafting of their CDP page than their sustainability initiatives. I found that in Amcor’s Engagement section specifically, there was a lot of repetition of green buzzwords like transparency, ethics and responsibility. The repetition of these words within a line of text or two from each other feel like they just copy pasted the exact same sentence. Personally, this makes me feel like they are just including these terms to check boxes, which discredits their commitment to their sustainability goals in my eyes. 

Helen of Troy LP was especially disappointed, as they had neither Carbon Reduction nor Renewable Energy targets in their ESG report. Thus, I think they can both improve in these areas. They could invest in RE implementation on their sites in order to further reduce the amount of GHG emissions they produce yearly. They also don't have a low-carbon technology adoption plan, which is surprising seeing as they market the brands they represent as ""green"", especially brands like HydroFlask and Osprey for example. The main focus of their ESG report was on reducing single-use plastic in their packaging, which is an important cause. However, this type of cause falls short if they don't do much to offset the carbon they produce or work to significantly reduce it, period. Again, there is a disparity between the green language they use in their reports and the action they take to make a positive impact on the environment and reduce their climate impacts. Thus, I think they should devote more time to figure out strategies and targets, instead of dedicating all of their resources to innovating the design of their products.

However, their section on water lacks any mention of reducing water usage in their products or transitioning away from liquid-based products. By reducing the liquid content in their products, they can significantly diminish the environmental impact associated with transportation, owing to reduced weight, and decrease the need for plastic packaging. Some companies have successfully implemented refill systems in which end-users add water themselves.

Colgate-Palmolive can concentrate on research and development (R&D) and enhance transparency in their supply chains and products. Shifting towards sustainable and responsible sources for plant-based raw materials and products should be a priority. Additionally, they should strive to hold their suppliers more accountable for their farming practices when sourcing raw materials. Historically, Colgate-Palmolive has faced criticism for making promises about sourcing natural products from non-responsible or unsustainable plantations without delivering on these commitments. It is imperative that they ensure their stated commitments are being upheld. One effective method to achieve this is by subjecting their actions to scrutiny by third-party auditors, thus holding themselves accountable for their actions.

Suppliers have to meet minimum requirements for sustainability when they sign a contract with Amore Pacific. They also collaborated with the Korean government to promote an eco-friendly consumption culture by reducing plastic packaging materials. They are also developing products that are easier to recycle.

They have no clear policy/target for carbon reduction and their renewable energy policies are minimal. They do, however, have clear packaging reduction goals. I would advise Ulta Beauty to start with the low-hanging fruit for carbon reduction such as energy efficiency improvements and material sourcing and then move on from there. Establishing an internal cost of carbon can help them internalize their externalities and quantify the impacts of the carbon emissions in a monetary firm, allowing them to adequately choose carbon reduction projects that align with their budget.

","The company is not investing in decarbonization inventions but is in business innovation through its ownership of Zipcar, a car sharing, primarily EV/Hybrid business which can be a method for reducing the number of cars produced through rental/sharing of cars. Zipcar is more of a business vs technological innovation. It is more of an adopter than creator. ","The company offers corporate clients carbon offsets.

","It does not really. It does ask suppliers to ""support"" Hertz by reducing their carbon footprint and claims to not utilize suppliers who comply with environmental laws. It also has began partnering with Uber to offer its electric cars to Uber drivers to use for ride-sharing.","Avis and Hertz are notable as ICE cars and business travel are particularly harmful, yet rental cars are a main source of used cars and thus can be a key conduit for the broader adoption of affordable EV's at scale. Although Avis scores a B and has stated emissions/renewable goals, Hertz (C grade) seems further in the EV transition. 

Avis has committed to 30% reduction in emissions vs 2018 by 2030. This goal is very low as 99% of its scope 1 emissions are from ICE cars. It currently has an EV fleet of only 4.5% and increasing this number is the single best practice Avis can implement. The company should also copy Hertz and support EV charger infrastructure. 

Hertz will have a 25% EV/hybrid fleet in 2024, this has partially been possible because it sold much of its fleet during its 2020 bankruptcy. The company should implement more aggressive emissions goals. Hertz should copy Avis and implement goals in achieving zero-waste for tires, water-shields, motor oils, and car batteries. 

Finally, both should expand partnerships with Uber/Lyft to provide EVs to their drivers, increasing EV penetration, growing the sharing economy, and also improving profitability through higher fleet utilization rates.

Many H&M garments are made of inorganic fibers like polyester while Reformation uses organic fibers such as cotton, viscose, and silk. H&M says they are beginning to purchase regeneratively farmed cotton which is a good start. They should also address their business as a fast fashion giant and commit to higher quality garments that would have less need for the repair and recycling programs they are pushing.

Reformation offsets all the energy they use by purchasing renewable energy credits, so an area of improvement for them would be to reduce their energy usage upfront.

One area BP invests in to support their carbon neutrality is carbon sinks: furthering investment on these technologies or operations to develop it themselves would help BP as a fossil fuel company improve their sustainability efforts. 

Vestas is a highly sustainable company already with targets far exceeding the standards of the Paris Agreement.

There is however, a lack of specifics on the phasing out of the fossil fuel projects that are a part of its portfolio (25% of its energy production). There could be a more detailed plan to try to shut down (rather than simply sell off which would continue the emissions coming from these assets) the fossil fuel operations.There is also a lack of language about supply chain sustainability and the company's internal price on carbon is too low. 

Shell has lofty goals for its target of net carbon reduction in emissions of 100% by 2050, but it seems like these are hollow promises. The current reductions and percentage of the company that has been invested in green energy is comparatively very small. Shell needs more direct investment in green energy and should be working to transition its business model away from fossil fuels, rather than simply trying to expand on CCS technologies as its main driver of sustainability. Without cutting fossil fuel production it seems unlikely that Shell will meet its net reduction targets.

In their report on sustainable packaging, they mention that they want to ensure that plastic packaging is 100% reusable or recyclable. I believe they should aim to make their packaging biodegradable which means they could partner up with a company that offers biodegradable packaging to replace their plastic packaging. 

Giorgio Armani- I really like the effort Armani puts into being more sustainable. I think they can work on their water management. They dispose of water coming from their factories which can cause a lot of water pollution in neighboring cities. Instead of dumping their wastewater into sewage, groundwater, or surface waters, they should find a way to filter the water so they can reuse it in their production.

The Science-Based Target initiative has verified (until 2025) that the company's emission reduction targets are meeting most ambitious 1.5 scenario.  ","In order to power a net-zero future, Siemens Gamesa has adopted 'six emission reduction levers': (1) energy reduction and efficiency measures; (2) electricity supply from renewable sources; (3) green mobility and fleet plan; (4) offsetting projects for non-avoidable emissions; (5) employee awareness campaigns and idea management; (6) increased engagement across the value chain. ","Siemens Gamesa is adopting alternative technologies for installation and service vessels. As well as, seeking alternative materials for high recyclability in their products. 
Siemens Gamesa has independently developed the 'RecyclableBlade', a first of its kind product, that offers a comprehensive solution for commercial use in offshore wind. This innovation will ensure that wind turbines can be recycled and reused in other industries to the benefit of future generations. ","Siemens Gamesa is making long-term investments in decarbonization innovations in multiple ways. As mentioned in the previous response, ""Siemens Gamesa has independently developed the 'RecyclableBlade', a first of its kind product, that offers a comprehensive solution for commercial use in offshore wind. This innovation will ensure that wind turbines can be recycled and reused in other industries to the benefit of future generations."" Secondly, the company has developed a new 'GreenerTower', which will reduce 20% total CO2e emissions from the wind turbine. The 'GreenerTower' uses less of steel plate in the production of the tower compared to a normal steel tower used to support wind turbines. The focus of this new tower is to significantly reduce CO2e emissions in the steel plate production for steel towers, the average CO2e emission on steel is 1.91 tons, compared to the 'GreenerTower' with a maximum of 0.7 tons of CO2e. 
The company is also making investments towards producing 100% recyclable turbines by 2040.  ","Seimens Gamesa partakes in collaborative measures with selected suppliers in order to develop a global downstream supply chain strategy.

Additionally, the company is promoting 'self consumption' -- installing of solar panels on consumers homes and developing 'solar tariffs' that will enable consumers to get the most benefit from self consumption. 
Outside of normal business operations Endesa has embarked on numerous sustainability projects, such as, the 'Endesa Forest Project' to rehabilitate forest land while removing large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. 
The Company has also entered into an international agreement under the United Nation's Global Compact, committing to uphold sustainable development goals.  ","Endesa participates in the progressive development of new technologies to drive the energy transition such as: the large-scale adoption of digital technologies to transform platform based operating and business models and increased storage capacity.  ","The baseline for Endesa's long-term planning considers the objectives of the Paris Agreement keeping global temperature below 2C. In order to achieve this goal the company invests in the development of technological solutions that will facilitate the flexibility of the electricity system. 
Endesa's 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan pursues longterm value creation by increasing solar and wind power capacity with a goal of achieving 91% of emission free mainland energy production by 2025. ","Endesa's goal is to build a resilient and sustainable supply chain that integrates the circular economy perspective, fosters innovation, and shares the company's objectives. Endesa requires (and supports) its suppliers in complying with sustainability criteria. Through the supplier rating system, the company verifies that suppliers are in line with the strategic vision and share in sustainability goals.  ","Siemens Gamesa has been a pioneer in the space of sustainable innovation related to renewable energy infrastructure. They have shown to be leaders in developing renewable energy products that will (hopefully) propel sustainable innovation within the energy sector. Although, Siemens Gamesa innovative 'RecyclableBlade' and 'GreenerTowers'  have begun to pave the way in sustainable renewable energy infrastructure, their achievements/goals should not be limited to just infrastructure innovation. Given that this is a company centered around renewable energy procurement and distribution, they should be more focused on developing long-term battery storage capacity. Due to the fact that clean energy sources do not offer consistent production of energy there is a need to innovate technologies that will support the transition to a clean energy future. In order to support Siemens Gamesa goals of reducing global GHG emissions and contributing to the decarbonization of the economy, the company should direct their focus towards generating reliable power grids supported by 100% renewable energy made possible by developing long-term battery storage capacity. 

Endesa operates under the main goal of delivering a competitive energy generation base with a quality and reliable energy supply to meet the growing needs of its consumers. Although, Endesa was one of the first Spanish companies to adhere to the United Nation's Global Compact, the company is still actively participating in the procurement of coal and fossil fuel generated energy to support the majority of their energy distribution to end-users. In order for Endesa to make good on their international sustainability commitments, the company needs to seriously begin focusing on energy procurement from renewable energy sources. Endesa's 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan pursues longterm value creation by increasing solar and wind power capacity with a goal of achieving 91% of emission free mainland energy production by 2025, without the immediate focus being turned towards renewable energy procurement and distribution Endesa will fail to meet 2025 renewable energy targets.

I have personally seen the amount of waste that happens on the daily while working at a Starbucks, so I could only imagine how much it adds up from each store location. If there was a certain store mandate for food waste, this corporation would be much more successful in reaching their sustainability goals. 

As for McDonald’s Corporation, they seem to really be focused on being more sustainable through their use of energy, which is great, but they could also focus on fully cutting their use of plastic for consumer packaging. Many McDonald’s locations still use plastic cups, food containers, utensils and utensil packaging, etc., that they can instead switch out for more sustainable materials. Even switching to more sustainable toys for the happy meals, which are a high selling item, would help make it a more sustainable company.

They don’t mention much about their plans other than understand water efficiency and partner with organizations that focus on sustainable practices with one of their focuses being water efficiency. The fashion industry’s largest impacts come from waste and water use so I think this is an area that is very crucial to focus on. Reformation exceeds in eco-consciousness in various sectors but I think that water efficiency is a bit overlooked; thus Reformation should focus on and implement specific strategies to lessen their water impact. 

Ralph Lauren should focus on reducing their Scope 3 emissions through similar partnerships that Reformation is doing with their materials production. Reformation acknowledged that cashmere accounted for a half of their scope 3 emissions while only being 1% of their products while Ralph Lauren tries to use cashmere is a sustainability initiative. They state their products use “recycled materials, including cotton, wool, cashmere, and polyester” which are “low-carbon products because manufacturing them requires less virgin raw materials”. Statements like these lead me to believe that Ralph Lauren needs to research the impact of their materials more and implement programs to specifically target the emissions produced by textiles.

Supplier agreements mandate compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. Audits are conducted on both new and high-risk suppliers, covering quality, environmental management, health and safety, labor, human rights, and ethics, with access to advanced due diligence tools and third-party audits through the RBA.","For PG&E, there's a significant opportunity to enhance sustainability efforts by prioritizing the affordability and accessibility of renewable energy, particularly through community solar projects. Lowering the cost of solar installations and fostering community engagement can drive a broader transition to clean energy. Furthermore, integrating carbon awareness by customizing sustainability initiatives to meet specific community needs is vital. This approach not only promotes democratization but also ensures a more tailored and effective transition to sustainable practices. By focusing on these aspects, PG&E can make sustainability more accessible and impactful, benefiting both the environment and the communities it serves.

A key sustainability opportunity for First Solar Inc. is to optimize their supply chain and distribution network. By producing solar panels nationally or using them where they were manufactured, they can significantly reduce transportation-related emissions and minimize the carbon footprint associated with shipping. This move not only aligns with sustainability goals but also enhances efficiency and reduces costs. Streamlining the logistics of their products can be a game-changer, making their solar panels more environmentally friendly and economical. Focusing on this aspect can be the one big thing that advances First Solar's sustainability efforts and strengthens their position in the industry.

While this method of farming would be extremely beneficial in reducing emissions. There are still many more avenues both companies can improve up in their sustainability efforts.

Syngenta is a leader in the biopesticide market. While Syngenta proposed developing workshops with chemical suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint. I believe it would make a larger impact to fully transfer production over to the biopesticide market. Biopesticides are naturally occurring pest control mechanisms such as pest predators, fungi, and semiochemicals that naturally control pests without the need for synthetic chemical manufacturing. This focus on biopesticides would not only allow Syngenta to reach its climate goals quicker but would also open up a vital market. 

On the other hand, Bayer AG could learn from Syngenta’s chemical supplier audits and compliance checks. The company relies largely in synthetic chemicals, so it should ensure that its suppliers are financially incentivized to uphold emissions caps as well as penalized when these restrictions are violated. Bayer AG should also continue to invest in developing environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic chemicals such as high yield variety crops that are not damaging to the crop rotation cycle.

For instance, their CLP Program “ensures” their suppliers are sustainable. However, it is quite unclear how they will help their suppliers or keep track of this. Thus, I propose that they must create a detailed plan on how they can directly support their suppliers to implement low-carbon technologies, reduce emissions, and sustainably source materials. They must create an official system that audits the suppliers to ensure they are only working with sustainable factories.  

Reformation, the disruptor, has made significant promises and is transparent with their actions. Their goal is to be entirely circular by 2030. They have several impactful initiatives that are transforming their business. However, one initiative they should focus more on is investment in decarbonization innovation. Currently, they are pursuing projects related to sustainable supply chains or maintaining 100% renewable energy.

energy consumption. Many of their refineries use power from renewable sources either from local power grids or from their own projects. ","NA","Last year, more than 40% of growth capital expenditures were invested in low-carbon projects. In 2021, Valero is allocating more than 50% of growth capital expenditures to low-carbon projects. The CEO notes said Valero is evaluating and advancing investments in sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen, carbon sequestration and more. ","The extent of their supply chain engagement is the engagement involved to develop their low-carbon fuel strategy.","Iberdrola aspires to achieve carbon neutrality for Scopes 1 and 2 by 2040, offsetting any residual emissions after 2030. The ultimate aspiration of this commitment is to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2040. Their plan is to increase its installed renewable, onshore and offshore wind, photovoltaic, battery and hydroelectric capacity, plus electricity grids.","Iberdrola committed 20 years ago to renewable energies and that has led it to invest more than €140,000 million since then. It will continue with an investment plan of €47,000 million between 2023 and 2025, focused on increasing its installed renewable, onshore and offshore wind, photovoltaic, battery and hydroelectric capacity, plus electricity grids.","Iberdrola makes a significant contribution to increasing reliability in system operation by providing great flexibility pumping capacity. Hydroelectric pumping technology is the most efficient system that allows to store energy in a large-scale today. Pumped hydroelectric plants thereby bring efficient energy storage, offer a long-term solution and facilitate the integration of renewable energies into the system and bring high returns.
Iberdrola is leader in energy storage with a capacity of 4,500 MW installed using pump technology.","The extent of their low-carbon technology includes their 20-25 year plan of wind and solar development and measures for the conversion of conventional plants (turbination only) to mixed pumping / turbination plants, using existing reservoirs.","Iberdrola invested a total of 337.5 million euros in R&D in 2021, a 15% increase over 2020. Their startup program, Iberdrola Ventures - PERSEO, has channelled investments of more than €85 million in start-ups in the energy sector worldwide. More than 25 pilot projects were carried out with start-ups in technological areas such as IoT, robotics and batteries, and in network construction and maintenance, hybridization of land use (agrivoltaics), electric mobility, and energy efficiency. Iberdrola Ventures invested in sectors resistant to decarbonization, (industrial heat production and heavy transport). This initiative prompted the Net-Zero MAR Partnership, which focuses on the decarbonization of the maritime sector.","Iberdrola runs an engagement campaign to educate suppliers about climate change and encourages environmental responsibility with a suppliers award that features climate change performance. The award produced a progressive approach of suppliers and supplies towards the sustainable parameters required by the company, causing a multiplier effect on the entire value chain. Iberdrola also offers financial incentives for suppliers who reduce their upstream emissions. They ran a campaign that was sent to 85% of suppliers to encourage innovation to reduce climate impacts on products and services. The results on the survey on SDGs show that 561 suppliers have specific objectives and plans to undertake their commitments, and many of the actions are coordinated from Foundations or corporative volunteering teams. Iberdrola also collects climate change and carbon information at least annually from suppliers.","Valero has the opportunity to conduct energy audits to identify areas where energy efficiency can be improved within the company's facilities, including production processes, transportation, and logistics. Valero could also take note of other distruptors in the energy industry and consider investing in carbon offset projects as well as implementing an internal carbon pricing mechanism to incentivize emissions reductions. One big thing Valero can focus on is increasing the use of renewable energy sources to power its operations. Valero can invest in on-site solar and wind energy generation and electrify processes where feasible to reduce reliance on fossil-based electricity. They should also increase their investments research and development to discover more efficient and sustainable ways of producing biofuels.
	Opportunities for Iberdrola include investing in and developing a broader range of renewable energy sources such as geothermal and ocean energy. Another opportunity is investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and collaborate with automakers to support the adoption of electric vehicles for carbon emissions reduction in the transportation sector. Iberdrola still depends to a large extent on natural gas and even acquired additional fossil fuel capacity in the US and Mexico in 2020.

None of this mentions factories directly, which seems like it would be the most important site for energy consumption.

They are interested in renewable energy facilities and being 100% renewably powered by 2050. ","Their work with making supply chains more sustainable is a prominent aspect of the report but fails to provide us with any significant, concrete details on what this actually changes in regard to the company’s sustainability. The report goes into details about wet processing suppliers, in which Indidex claims they engage the supply chain in carbon reduction by working with their wet processing suppliers which are have the highest energy and water consumption of suppliers. They run an engagement campaign that educates these suppliers on sustainability (77% of which were wet process suppliers). Their focus is on education, communications, and training with supply chains, but fails to mention what that how that would effect the actual operations of suppliers. Something potentially fruitful in relation to consumers is working toward circularity through a program called Closing the Loop that encourages customers to donate garments they no longer want through a variety of donation sources. This program has taken in 78,500 tons of garments since 2015. The company also stresses this program heavily in the report.

They want to emphasize recycled materials. Like Inditex, a prominent interest is circularity and the creation of resale/upcycle/recycle programs. ","Like Inditex, they are interested in carbon offsetting programs. These are largely energy distribution projects (like the distribution of clean energy cooking stoves) but also a forest project. ","Reformation is also interested in engagement of suppliers (also using the word “incentivization”), having suppliers complete the HIGG FEM, which encourages sustainable changes.

Inditex mentions in their sustainability report that they are investing in the creation of “next-generation materials” that can be scaled at the size of their company, while also being sustainable. Reformation makes similar allusions to this idea, explaining that many of their current materials (while natural and not synthetic like most of Inditex's) are carbon-intensive and we must look to new, undiscovered materials. I’d like to see both companies actually investing in this research in a tangible way, or else working with present materials that are not chemical or carbon-intensive. I also like the work both companies are doing with the idea of circular economy at the consumer end, both implementing initiatives toward the reselling of their unwanted garments, the donation system of Inditex, and the intentional longevity of Reformation’s garments. Both companies must also outline how the educational materials they are providing their suppliers is actually changing the way their materials are being produced. In both CDP reports, the companies use the word “engagement” to describe how they bring awareness to suppliers but fail to explain what the supplier then does with this information.","https://www.inditex.com/itxcomweb/api/media/cdcf54dd-4c9b-4ee9-92ab-f55d28d65901/Inditex+New+Sustainability+Commitments.pdf?t=1690537968645","","https://media.thereformation.com/image/upload/v1683921070/pdfs/Reformation-Annual-Report-2022.pdf?_gl=1*dm0rsv*_up*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQjwx5qoBhDyARIsAPbMagA3lrC2iqfsQdKqPo7_nUm18PGgc1s9Vt2tJ5xLxjmxOO1BEoHHtpcaAqCKEALw_wcB","","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1SO4rqrtgXP1SMGVHyl1qJGruEtWlaO-Z"

3) Partnership with Parley for the Oceans: Produced more than 18 million pairs of shoes containing Parley Ocean Plastic, thus reduced dependency on nonrenewable petroleum and decreased carbon impact.","  Fila Holdings Corp is an incumbent company in footwear industry but it currently has no specific carbon reduction or renewable energy target in the reported year. Other big footwear & apparel companies like Adidas and Nike are starting sustainable production using renewable energy, with specific targets. Fila Holdings Corp has mentioned that they would set the targets in 2 years but sustainability is a urgent matter. They should focus more on setting carbon emission, renewable energy targets and then specify short-term plans to achieve the goal.
  Adidas AG is known for one of the sustainability ""disruptor"" firms. They showed efforts to introduce sustainability by internal energy innovation and partnerships. Adidas AG has a sustainability strategy in sections, so they should mostly focus on achieving the carbon emission target, which is reducing 90% of emission by 2025. Achieving an unconventional target of nearly 100 percent will require a meticulous strategy, and in the process, loopholes may appear in the existing strategy. Efforts should be made to become a sustainable innovative company while complementing this well.

Key areas of focus for this company include responsibly sourcing their materials, expanding their circularity message to consumers, transitioning to ocean and ground shipping, improving energy efficiency, and reducing emissions within their supply chain. One major focus for Reformation is their supply chain considering it accounts for ⅔ of their carbon footprint. In order to improve this, they should continue to invest in their Factory Forward program and follow consultations from other NGO groups. However, along with providing targets and advice, they should appropriate more funding to directly invest in their supply chain considering only ⅓ of the operations report their energy use, and probably less than that are actively changing their policies. 

Being such a large company, Adidas has a surprisingly high rating for their sustainability efforts. One major aspect they can improve on is accuracy and transparency with their reporting. Their last internal sustainability report that is published is from 2016, meaning that most of the information I found was from the CDP report (which is why I linked it as the sustainability report). While they have ambitious goals and targets, more data on recent emissions is crucial to see if progress is being made. Outside of reporting, Adidas should be looking further into the materials they use, expand on energy efficiency, improve supply chain management and sustainability, and emphasize circularity. They should consider having a sustainability campaign to encourage consumers to keep products longer and implement a recycling program for unwanted gear.

They seek to reduce these emissions by 20% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 compared to 2018. They have currently achieved 2% of the former target and 1% of the latter. They most need to reduce the carbon emissions of their upstream suppliers (which accounts for 95% of their total GHG emissions). Dairy and livestock are the largest single source of emissions in their supply chain. They could consider education campaigns, financial incentives, or increasing the efficiency of their supply chain.

Blue Diamond must first identify their overarching sustainability goals to guide their efforts; they should establish an emissions reduction and renewable energy target and create a comprehensive plan to achieve these goals. Currently, they do not have any reported goals because they are “investigating the science behind on-farm sequestration to chart a path toward reducing emissions even while crop size is estimated to increase.” The firm must find a way to increase their yield while decreasing emissions, such as regenerative agroforestry or carbon sequestration. They could also establish and enforce environmental standards across all of their growers, rather than simply incentivizing optional educational courses for individual farmers.","https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2023-03/creating-shared-value-sustainability-report-2022-en.pdf","https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&discloser_id=972398&locale=en&organization_name=Nestl%C3%A9&organization_number=12942&program=Investor&project_year=2022&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F201969&survey_id=78646008","https://media.bluediamond.com/static/components/sustainability/2022_Sustainability_Report_Final_Online_Version.pdf","https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&discloser_id=971358&locale=en&organization_name=Blue+Diamond+Growers&organization_number=38410&program=Investor&project_year=2022&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F215162&survey_id=78646008","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1hyTZ5yXSNvixsHHzObCsfeMqaq8CLeCx"

They have the goal of hitting net zero by 2040 across all supply chains. They also want scale up their circular model of their products- no date mentioned. ","H&M stated the general goal of switching all manufacturing facilities to renewables energy by 2030. They also mention striving to hit a 20-25% mark up on energy efficiency.  There is no plan for  transportation sector, just manufacturing.","H&M states that want to target climate resilience, carbon-sinks, nature-based solutions, regenerative agriculture and relates to emissions in both our own operations and those across our value chain. They have the goal to decrease per product water usage by 38% by 2030, no plan outlined. ","H&M purchased a removal service in direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) through Climeworks. They have invested in less carbon intensive silk production with the University SLU. They are investing in technologies to improve the processing of recycled materials, rather than sourcing new raw materials. ","The company broadly says that they are investing in technology such as carbon sinks and carbon capture. In terms of long-term investments they mention carbon capture and storage called DACCS which is a chemical process to capture and separate carbon dioxide molecules from the air.  ","H&M mentions that they are drafting a coal-phase out projects, coal-phase out for our own supply chain (which will drive reductions for all brands in our supplier factories) and a common investment fund through the Apparel impact institute. As well, have outlined the following: Run an engagement campaign to educate suppliers about climate change, Directly work with suppliers on exploring corporate renewable energy sourcing mechanisms, Climate change performance is featured in supplier awards scheme, Offer financial incentives for suppliers who reduce your upstream emissions (Scopes 3), and Offer financial incentives for suppliers who increase the share of renewable energy in their total energy mix. They are starting this with the largest suppliers first, with a top-down approach. They have developed a Green investment team that provides a myriad of investment tactics to these supplier groups to make the switch to more clean energy practices. They are a part of the sustainable apperal coalition. ","Reformation had the goal of cutting emission by 46%, but cut them by 0%. They have the stated goal of net positive by 2025. ","Reformation has the renewable energy goals of: updating the accuracy of data to tackle emission sources more effectively, reduce natural gas, conduct an energy audit of Reformation’s facilities to identify specific energy efficiency measures, and receive internal fiscal approval for solar panel array installation for 150,000 sq ft Headquarters, Factory, and Operations building. ","Reformation had a very detail outline of the steps they want further their efficiency all in: better materials that are less carbon intensive but still good quality, to further Eliminate Silk, Eliminate conventional cashmere and Source more recycled materials. They also discuss the idea of establishing circularity by developing upcycling and resale programs they could see ~11-23% total reduction potential in our materials footprint. They mention shifting majority of transportation to cargo ships. They also are going to start conducting energy audits to better understand how and when they're using energy. Then they'll work on reducing natural gas consumption throughout all parts of our business. Launching a buy back plan for store credit as well as a RefRecycle program with the goal to making a closed material loop. ","Reformation has mentioned as stated above new material choices that are less carbon intensive, recycled materials, as well as switching their infrastructure away from using natural gas. They have looked, but were unable to, build solar panels for personal infrastructure. ","The biggest investments that are being taken are in material usage and transportation to produce less carbon. In the content of materials, they want to find new ways to produce very water intensive raw materials as well as a buy back and recycling programs. For transportation they are trying to switch away completely from aviation and more via cargo-ships.  ","Reformation They have partnered with the Apparel Impact Institute and South Pole which help them develop and strategize the ways to work with suppliers to move towards more sustainable practices. They also encourage their supply chains to process a Higg FEM, which informs manufacturers, brands, and retailers about the environmental performance of their individual facilities, empowering them to scale sustainability improvements. The Higg FEM provides facilities with a clear picture of their environmental impacts. It helps them identify and prioritize opportunities for performance improvements. ","Both companies are making impressive headways in the apparel industry. Both have a very detailed report both on the CDP as well as their own published plan on their websites. H&M, of course is the bigger more incumbent company. They have had a complicated relationship surrounding their sustainable endeavors; and have established as notorious 'green-washing' company. Their plan for 2022 must be a direct result of this bad press as they are taking some big steps for a company of their size. I think they are fully addressing the sectors that are involved in, and have outlines some progress in those fields. How they must improve is to be much more clear and focused on their projects. As of now they have mostly just hired a staff to tell them what to do but have not made any real investments; to show their consumers they are being productive they must invest in some new infrastructure (in facility energy, material choice, labor conditions/pay, transportation energy, and much more). Reformation is a much smaller company on scale to H&M. What Reformation has done really well is that they have shaped their business model and client base around sustainability.  This makes progress with changing their business practices that much easier- both for investors, supply chains, and overall customer satisfaction. What reformation lacked in their plan was a more holistic lens to their production. While addressed, they had no clear plan on how they could make their scope 2 and 3 production less carbon intensive. This is crucial for a business profiting off the label of 'sustainability', and parameters to what that means should be more discussed. Doing some sustainable practices is not enough anymore; we must push for a more sustainable supply chain as well as company.

One big thing that can be done to reduce emissions is to engage suppliers and form a plan of how to do so. Their ESG report discusses goals and plans to reduce food waste and outlines the severity of food waste within US supply chains but does not specifically address their short and long term actions to solve this within Albertsons supply chains. 

Ahold Delhaize does a good job providing comprehensive data as well as reporting on how they’ve calculated emissions within each scope. One thing they could work on is committing to reducing food waste. Their ESG report depicts reduction in food waste compared to a baseline from 2016 while most of their other data compares to a 2018 baseline. This makes their report feel a little bit misleading when comparing different data sets.

In my research I discovered that the financial disruptor is actually more than a century old, but only transitioned to a digital banking company which took off in the 2000s. As a disruptor, Ally is familiar with looking ahead, so it’s concerning that they have little to no investments in decarbonization technology. The extent of their investment in low-carbon technology only goes as far as setting a goal to make 30%+ of their real estate portfolio (remember, they operate 0 brick-and-mortar branches, only corporate buildings) LEED certified. Therefore, they are in dire need of investing into decarbonization innovation themselves, to get ahead of the game. 

JPMorgan and Co. is surprisingly doing quite well in most carbon reduction opportunity areas. What emissions they have not been able to mitigate, they “make up for” (depending on who you ask) by purchasing supposedly high-quality carbon credits and applicable EACs. Where they can most improve is in the supply chain. Currently they have 3 programs which: 
Educate suppliers on how they can “integrate positive environmental practices,”
Conduct a third-party sustainability assessment of the top 850 suppliers in order to establish future baselines, and
Create a “financial institution consortium” to provide a forum for industry best practices respectively. 
These programs look nice on paper but are weak and ultimately futile in practice. Unless JPMorgan and Co. sets supplier standards for itself, the supply chain will continue to be wasteful and inefficient.
