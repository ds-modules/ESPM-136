This notation is Python's way of displaying very large or very small numbers. `e+` in this case means a positive power of 10 (`e-` would be a negative power, which would be a way of representing very small decimal numbers). So, when you see a number like `e+06`, this means $10^6$, which is a million. In the table above, `7.25451e+06` means $7.25451 * 10^6$, which is actually equal to $7,254,510$.
